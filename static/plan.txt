HOME PAGE SECTION:
-Mention the name and a quick overview on what carbon footprint means
-Mention that this app does not take into account your food intake. Food also contributes to your carbon footprint. Mention that you should consider avoiding 
domesticated/processed meat/food. Switch to plan-based food. 

Logic:
Sum (footprint value) = 0

Add the following calculations to sum:
1. Monthly Electricity Bill (x 105)
2. Monthly gas Bill (x 105)
3. Monthly oil bill (x 113)
4. Yearly mileage (x .79)
5. Num flights (< 4hrs) (x 1100)
6. Num flights (>= 4 hrs) (x 4400)
7. Recycle Newspaper NO? => +184 else +0
8. Recycle aluminum and tin  No? => +166 else +0

if sum < 6000 => Excellent. if sum between 6000 and 15999 => Good. if sum between 16000 and 22000 => avg. else => Poor
